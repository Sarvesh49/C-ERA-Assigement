/*In C, unformatted input/output functions are the most basic form of handling input and output. These functions do not allow you to specify a format for input or display output in a user-desired format. Here are some commonly used unformatted input/output functions in C:

getch(): Reads a single character from the user at the console without echoing it (i.e., without displaying it on the screen).
getche(): Reads a single character from the user at the console and echoes it (displays it on the screen).
getchar(): Reads a single character from the user at the console, echoes it, but requires the user to press the Enter key at the end.
gets(): Reads a single string entered by the user at the console.
puts(): Displays the value of a single string at the console.
putch(): Displays a single character value at the console.
putchar(): Displays a single character value at the console.
These functions are called “unformatted” because 
you don’t need to use any format specifiers when using them. 
They directly read or display values without any specific formatting requirements*/
